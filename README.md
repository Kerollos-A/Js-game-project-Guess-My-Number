# 🎯 Guess My Number Game

A simple number guessing game built while learning from Jonas Schmedtmann’s **"The Complete JavaScript Course"**.  
**I implemented the game logic using JavaScript**, including number generation, user input handling, score calculation, and feedback messages.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Guess a number between **1 and 20**.
2. You start with a **score of 20** — each wrong guess decreases your score.
